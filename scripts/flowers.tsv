Common names	Genus	Colors	Petals	Petal edge	Size	Flower shape	Tree?	Description
evergreen candytuft	Iberis	white	many	rounded square	small	cluster	no	Candytuft! What a delightful name for a delightful flower. There is something immensely satisfying (but also frightening) about a cluster of flowers so thick you can't see any green. 
scarlet globemallow	Sphaeralcea	orange	5	notched	small	bowl	no	Not totally scarlet, globular, or mallow-y, this nonetheless pleasant wildflower is also known as "cowboy's delight." In late spring you can see large patches of these on drier hills in Utah, whether or not you're on horseback.
spreading phlox	Phlox	pink	5	round;rounded square	small	flat	no	These flowers really do spread—you can catch them in enormous patches in shady areas pretty easily, because they can't run.
Sarah Bernhardt peony	Paeonia	pink	many	notched;ruffled	large	carnation-like	no	This enormous, gorgeous flower is like a giant cross between a carnation and a rose.
showy milkweed	Asclepias	pink	5	pointy	large	ball	no	As far as I can tell, the show this flower's putting on is called "Ball of starfish."
tapertip onion	Allium	purple	many	pointy	small	ball	no	Also called Hooker's onion, this plant is allegedly quite delicious. 
Colorado blue columbine	Aquilegia	white	5	round	medium	star	no	I'm not completely sure that I've identified these flowers correctly, but I do know they're columbines—you can tell because they have funky little tails coming out the back (called "spurs").
smoothstem blazingstar	Mentzelia	yellow	5	pointy	large	star	no	This is one of my favorite wildflowers. I love its extravagant name! In early summer, you can find small shrubs in bloom with these highlighter-yellow flowers—act quick, though, because those shrubs will quickly dry out into sad skeletons.
chicory	Cichorium	purple	many	notched	small	daisy-like	no	This elusive purple-blue wildflower is a joy to spot! It's rather hard to pick off individual flowers, so I might recommend stealing the entire bush.
natal plum	Carissa	white	5	round	medium	star	no	These elegant stars are a perfect fit for beachside stroll aesthetics.
purple morning glory	Ipomoea	purple	5	notched	medium	trumpet	no	These are much more eye-catching than the pale pink morning glory that is slowly eating away my hometown.
Texas lantana	Lantana	yellow;orange	4	notched;round	small	cluster	no	Lantana is a common choice for city-street flowerpots. I love its colorful clusters, but I'm still not sure how many petals it has.
lion's tail	Leonotis	orange	many	fuzzy	small	cluster	no	This flower is also called "wild dagga," which sounds like a useful survival tool.
globe amaranth	Gomphrena	pink;purple	many	pointy;notched	small	ball	no	Wow! These vibrant blooms are extra cool when you look at them close up. At some point I'll add support for multiple photos on this site so you can have that experience.
balloon flower	Platycodon	purple	5	pointy	large	star	no	Strangely, these might be the least balloon-looking flowers I've ever seen.
toad lily	Tricyrtis	white;purple	6	round	small	star	no	I love these funky gems! They are NOTHING like toads!
dahlia	Dahlia	pink	many	round;notched	large	ball	no	A classy, easily recognizable flower with a name you could comfortably use on your kid.
fire vine	Ipomoea	red;orange;yellow	5	none	small	stalk	no	Also known as Spanish flag and firecracker vine, this silly flower brings to mind a pile of happy toucans!
bluemink	Ageratum	purple	many	pointy	small	cluster	no	I'm a huge fan of this flower's name, which seems like it came from a lazy guy trying to get out of his hunting duties back in the days when the color purple hadn't been invented yet. "I'm gonna go look for blue mink!" or something. You can also call it "flossflower."
crested cockscomb	Celosia	red;pink	many	ruffled	large	ruffle	no	I'm a little upset by this one because it's hard to categorize and looks way too much like a brain.
white campion	Silene	white	5	notched	small	gourd	no	When I look at these I imagine the taste of wintermelon, a vegetable I hate.
lanceleaf liveforever	Dudleya	red;orange;yellow	6	pointy	small	stalk	no	I think everything to know about this flower is included in its absurdly original name, the most flagrant offender I've seen of flower-namer-people Just Making Up Words since "smoothstem blazingstar."
seafoam statice	Limonium	purple;white	5	round;notched	small	cluster	no	A lovely cluster also known as Perez's sea lavender—take a moment to spot the intermittent little white flowers!
verbena	Verbena	purple	5	notched	small	cluster	no	It's a ball of flowers, hiding a fuzzy little secret...
painter's palette	Anthurium	red;yellow	2	fused	large	leaf	no	A leaf disguised as a flower, this thing is also called flamingo flower, oilcloth flower, and laceleaf.
Texas bluebonnet	Lupinus	purple;yellow;white	many	round	large	stalk	no	This photo was taken just off of a highway in Texas in the springtime, just like Lady Bird Johnson wanted. 
evening primrose	Oenothera	white;pink	4	notched	large	bag	no	I classify the shape of this flower as "bag" because no flower has looked more like a discarded plastic bag to me. These flowers have no integrity—this photo was taken at 8AM, a far cry from "evening."
sego lily	Calochortus	white	3	pointy	small	cup	no	Utah's state flower is much smaller than you might expect. Look closely off-trail in late spring to spot it, and be careful up close—sego lilies make good homes for spiders and other yucky bugs.
spider milkweed	Asclepias	green;purple	5	pointy	large	ball	no	Also called antelope horns milkweed, this flower is absolutely bonkers.
narrow-leaf penstemon	Penstemon	purple	5	round;notched	small	stalk	no	You can also call this plant toad-flax beardtongue—I'm not sure why.
thistle	Cirsium	purple	many	pointy	medium	gourd	no	This thistle is hosting a soldier beetle friend!
Lotus japonicus	Lotus	yellow	2	round;pointy	small	cluster	no	To my dismay, this cutie has no common name yet. Sunshine horseshoeflower, anyone?
musk-mallow	Malva	pink	5	notched	small	bowl	no	After looking at all these flowers called "mallow," I'm really curious who was responsible for naming marshmallows.
Queen Anne's lace	Daucus	white	many	round	large	cluster	no	Alternative names for this plant include wild carrot and bird's nest, neither of which evoke as fun of an image as Queen Anne's lace. If you look closely you can see a red dot in the center of the flower cluster that represents blood from Queen Anne pricking her finger while making the lace, which is pretty disgusting if you ask me.
bird vetch	Vicia	purple	2	round;fused	small	stalk	no	This flower has a lot of other arguably descriptive common names such as tufted vetch, boreal vetch, cow vetch, and blue vetch. The only thing the flower community seems to have agreed upon is that it's vetch!
red clover	Trifolium	pink	many	round;pointy	small	ball	no	:)
crownvetch	Securigera	pink	many	round	small	cluster	no	I would like to talk to the person who came up with the name vetch, because it sounds much too pointy for flowers!
buttonbush	Cephalanthus	white;brown	many	pointy	small	ball	no	Also called honey-bells, this flower was too spiky for this bee to linger long.
garden nasturtium	Tropaeolum	orange	5	ruffled;round;notched	medium	cup	no	Nasturtium is an appropriate name for a flower that is beautiful but looks like it would gossip if it could.
everlasting flower	Helichrysum	pink;white	many	round	small	daisy-like	no	I love the shiny mysteriousness of this flower! We may never know what it's hiding in its heart.
trumpet vine	Campsis	orange	5	round;notched	small	trumpet	no	The alternative name for this flower, "cow itch vine," raises a lot of questions.
desert wirelettuce	Stephanomeria	pink	5	notched	small	star	no	I had a hard time identifying this flower and may have done it wrong—I've thought before that it's skeletonplant. It's got impressive spork petals.
narrowleaf four o'clock	Mirabilis	white;pink	5	notched	small	trumpet	no	Four o'clocks were thusly named because they open at four o'clock, and I guess the people who named them had never been up at 7AM like I have.
Egyptian starcluster	Pentas	pink	5	pointy	small	cluster	no	The color of these flowers does not evoke Egypt for me. Instead, I'm thinking about a shirt I thought was cool in 2014...
Soprano Lilac Spoon African daisy	Osteospermum	white;pink	many	spoon	medium	daisy-like	no	These are some of the mesmerizingest flowers I've spotted. Also called Cape marguerite, their petals look like, but cannot be used as, spoons.
nemesia	Nemesia	pink;yellow	many	round;notched	medium	cluster	no	Tutu designers could learn a thing or two from these flowers!
spider flower	Grevilla	red;green	many	round;pointy	small	ball	no	I'd have named this anything other than spider flower.
blue felicia	Felicia	purple	many	round	small	daisy-like	no	This flower is another relic from the days before purple was invented.
tiger-eye pansy	Viola	yellow;brown	5	round;notched	small	flat	no	According to Wikipedia, pansies are hybrid creations, like mules.
anemone	Anemone	white;pink;red;purple	many	round;rounded square	large	bowl	no	Sea anemones were named after anemone flowers because both are colorful, which is hilarious because I can think of plenty of flowers that are just as colorful AND easier to spell.
common stork's-bill	Erodium	pink	5	round;rounded square	small	star	no	Also called redstem filaree and pinweed, this flower is known as stork's bill because it's got sharp, beak-looking seed-pods.
birdeye speedwell	Veronica	blue	4	round	small	bowl	no	Other names for this plant include winter speedwell and bird's-eye. 
dandelion	Taraxacum	yellow	many	notched	medium	circle	no	This one has a red soldier bug on it!
grape hyacinth	Muscari	purple	1	round;notched	small	stalk	no	Neither hyacinth nor grapes.
apple	Malus	white	5	round;ruffled	small	bowl	yes	I adore the smell of this flower! Much better than the fishy smell of the Bradford pear.
grass lily	Ornithogalum	white	6	pointy	small	cup	no	Also called nap-at-noon and eleven-o'clock lady, these little lilies were a stellar surprise to find on the side of a trail. 
Japanese wisteria	Wisteria	white;purple	2	fused;pointy;round	large	stalk	no	I'm not actually sure if this one is a tree.
Kanzan cherry	Prunus	pink	many	notched;ruffled	medium	carnation-like	yes	In my humble opinion, the best color of tree is pink!
Chinese redbud	Cercis	pink	5	round;fused	small	cluster	yes	With fiercely magenta flowers, these trees make a powerful contribution to any springtime neighborhood.
lilac	Syringa	white;pink	4	round	small	stalk	no	An unassuming shrub in most seasons, the lilac is a wonderful surprise in the spring.
Pursh's milkvetch	Astragalus	pink;purple	4	round;ruffled;fused	medium	cluster	no	So strangely shaped my janky classification system struggles to describe it, Pursh's milkvetch exists to push the boundaries of what a flower is. Why do the flowers come in threes (or maybe fours—is that a bud in the photo)? Why are they so long? What's going on with the petals?
meadow death camas	Toxicoscordion	white;yellow	5	ruffled;round	small	stalk	no	If you eat 2-6% of your body weight in meadow death camas, you'll probably die.
milkvetch	Astragalus	white;yellow	4	round;notched;fused	small	cluster	no	I'm not sure what variety of milkvetch this is—the other yellow-white milkvetches I found, on top of not having the same leaves as this one, tended to be native to an extremely specific region beyond where I found this. (Which is why we should have more dichotomous keys!)
firewheel	Gaillardia	red;yellow	many	pointy	medium	daisy-like	no	This sandy beauty is also known as Indian blanket, Indian blanketflower, or sundance. Its Wikipedia page contains more instances of the word "hairy" than one might expect.
society garlic	Tulbaghia	purple	6	round;pointy	medium	cluster	no	I adore the name society garlic, and its contrast to this flower's phlegmy genus name, Tulbaghia. You can also call this cluster pink agapanthus, which is silly because it's not pink, and "spring flowers," which is laughably generic.
oleander	Nerium	red	5	rounded square	medium	flat	no	A more accurate name for the shape of these might be "twisty star."
yellow hibiscus	Hibiscus	yellow	5	notched;ruffled	large	trumpet	no	Growing up, my dad would always call hibiscus "Rose of Sharon," which I've just now learned is a biblical phrase about some sort of flower that might not even be hibiscus.
baby sun rose	Mesembryanthemum	yellow;pink	many	round;pointy	small	daisy-like	no	Also called aptenia and heart-leaf, these little friends are a pleasure to catch opening when the sun's out.
shoeblackplant	Hibiscus	pink;red;yellow	5	notched;ruffled	large	trumpet	no	It's just a hibiscus, but for some reason we're calling it shoeblackplant.
cobblers pegs	Bidens	white;yellow	5	round;notched	small	star	no	It's so hard to choose a favorite among this flower's common names, which include beggarticks, black-jack, and farmer's friends.
daisy fleabane	Erigeron	white;yellow	many	round;pointy	small	daisy-like	no	Tiny little flowers!
cape leadwort	Plumbago	blue;purple	5	round;notched	medium	cluster	no	You can also call this stuff blue plumbago.
Virginia buttonweed	Diodia	white	4	pointy	small	star	no	According to Wikipedia, this stuff can be a "nuisance weed," but nonetheless, it makes my list of Things That Are Cooler To Use On Lawns Than Grass.
southern magnolia	Magnolia	white	many	round;pointy	large	bowl	yes	A humongous, superb flower. I'm upset that not all trees do this.
waterhyssop	Bacopa	white;blue	5	round;notched	small	cup	no	These teeny guys can also be called things like thyme-leafed gratiola and herb of grace.
seashore mallow	Kosteletzkya	pink;yellow	5	round;notched	medium	star	no	I can't believe it's not hibiscus!
purple arrowroot	Canna	orange	many	round;ruffled	large	stalk	no	This plant is also konwn as Indian shot, African arrowroot, Sierra Leone arrowroot, and edible canna. I chose to use the name "purple arrowroot" because I think it's hilarious that the person who named it just didn't want to talk about the giant orange flowers.
cutleaf evening primrose	Oenothera	pink;yellow;orange	many	round;ruffled	small	bag	no	I refuse to call the shape of primroses anything but "bag."
white oleander	Nerium	white	5	rounded square	medium	flat	no	Ooh ooh! Oleander, but white! 
African lily	Agapanthus	purple	many	round;pointy	large	ball	no	These happy blooms are also called lily of the Nile.
scarlet bottlebrush	Melaleuca	red	many	pointy	medium	ball	no	An excellently named, brilliantly executed ball of cheer. I think this is what pom-poms and fireworks should be.
spider hibiscus	Hibiscus	red	many	notched;round	medium	ball	no	Fantastic! More flowers should be lanterns.
peacock ginger	Kaempferia	purple;white	4	round	small	flat	no	At some point I might write up a little flower-to-name matching game that everyone will lose because this friend looks nothing like what comes to mind when anyone says "peacock ginger."
nipplewort	Lapsana	yellow	many	notched	small	cluster	no	Clearly an invasive species—who would want a nipple-wart?
fire-star orchid	Epidendrum	orange;red	5	pointy	medium	cluster	no	Five stars for fire stars!
weeping blue ginger	Dichorisandra	purple;white	3	ruffled;notched;round	medium	stalk	no	Weeping is an appropriate response when encountering flowers named by that one guy who never learned the word "purple."
Greve's orchid tree	Bauhinia	yellow;red	5	round;ruffled;notched	medium	bowl	yes	This thing is trying very hard to be a flower, and not succeeding at all, but I guess we can call it a flower anyway.
bush lily	Clivia	yellow;white;red	6	pointy;round	large	cluster	no	Another fabulous instance of nature making bouquets for us.
walking iris	Trimezia	yellow;brown	3	round;notched	medium	iris-like	no	These plants "walk" by sprouting in a line. Their coloration is very banana-like!
Dalmation Peach foxglove	Digitalis	pink	4	fused;round	medium	stalk	no	This plant, despite looking quite friendly, is made of poison.
daisy	Gerbera	yellow	many	round;pointy;notched	medium	daisy-like	no	Daisies are one of the most used cut flowers in the world! They are perfect.
fairy fan-flower	Scaevola	purple	5	ruffled;pointy	medium	cluster	no	It's fair to be a fan of the fairy fan-flower.
purple passionflower	Passiflora	purple;white	many	pointy	medium	circle	no	This thing is nuts! It's got everything! It's got little bone-looking structures, a polka-dot star, and funky wiggles! You can even call it maypop or wild apricot if you want.
cornflower	Centaurea	blue;purple	many	pointy	medium	circle	no	I find this flower beautiful and its alternate name, "bachelor's button," immensely satisfying.
Aztec marigold	Tagetes	orange	many	ruffled	medium	circle	no	Ruffle fluffle! A great flower.
calibrachoa	Calibrachoa	pink;white;yellow	5	pointy;fused	small	trumpet	no	These brightly colored friends are often mistaken for petunias.
marigold	Tagetes	orange;yellow;red	6	ruffled;notched;round	medium	flat	no	A happy group of blooms!
purple iris	Iris	purple;yellow;white	6	round;ruffled	medium	iris-like	no	This gentleman is also known as poison flag and northern blue flag, but I chose purple iris because I think it's the most straightforward. 
blue-eyed grass	Sisyrinchium	blue;yellow	6	pointy	small	star	no	I've never seen grass with eyes before!
Amur honeysuckle	Lonicera	white;yellow	5	rounded square;fused	medium	funky	no	Silly as it is, this plant is unpleasantly invasive.
black locust	Robinia	white;yellow	5	fused;round	large	funky	yes	I think it's rude that a flower and a bug have the same name.
false spikenard	Maiathemum	white	many	pointy	small	stalk	no	You can call this stuff treacleberry, feathery false lily of the valley, or Solomon's plume, but I think false spikenard is best because it cracks me up.
water forget-me-not	Myosotis	blue	5	notched	small	star	no	Wow wow wow! These are a delight to stumble upon.
golden alexander	Zizia	yellow	many	round	medium	cluster	no	It's like Queen Anne's lace, but better.
desert rose	Adenium	pink	5	ruffled	medium	trumpet	no	A pretty tropical friend!
crown of thorns	Euphorbia	pink	2	round;notched	small	cluster	no	The most Pepto-Bismol flower I've seen!
peregrina	Jatropha	red	5	round;pointy	small	star	no	I think this is peregrina (also known as spicy jatropha), but I'm not too confident in that identification.
pincushion flower	Scabiosa	purple	many	round;notched	small	circle	no	What a lovely flower! Pincushion is a much better name for it than its other common one, "small scabious."
climbing hydrangea	Hydrangea	white	4	round	large	cluster	no	This one is so silly! I saw an entire wall of it. It's kinda like if everyone on one of those spinny carnival rides stuck their legs out.
peach verbena	Verbena	red;orange;pink	5	notched;ruffled	small	cluster	no	I had to call out this particular variety of verbena because it's beautiful.
valerian	Valeriana	white;pink	5	round	small	cluster	no	I'm pretty sure the plant came before the TV show.
Festiva Maxima peony	Paeonia	white;red	many	ruffled;notched	large	carnation-like	no	Peonies are top-notch!
wild thyme	Thymus	purple	4	round;rounded square	small	cluster	no	If you eat this, you can say you had a wild thyme.
bloody geranium	Geranium	pink	5	ruffled	medium	bowl	no	You can also call geranium crane's-bill because it's got pointy seed pods that look like crane bills, but function quite differently.
chives	Allium	purple	many	pointy	small	ball	no	I love chives! Wow! I have one named Clive who is currently in the care of a lovely lady named Heidi in upstate New York.
common sage	Salvia	purple	2	fused	medium	stalk	no	At some point I'm going to have to figure out what the official name for this flower shape is.
dame's rocket	Hesperis	purple	4	notched	medium	cluster	no	It's so hard to choose a favorite common name for this one! I also like "night-scented gilliflower," "mother-of-the-evening," and "Good & Plenties."
Persian onion	Allium	purple	5	pointy	large	ball	no	I think the rule is: purple ball flower = onion.
Serenity Pink Magic African daisy	Osteospermum	pink	many	round;notched	medium	daisy-like	no	These flowers are seriously magical, and they look just as painted in real life. African daisies are such talented plants!
purple verbena	Verbena	purple;pink	5	notched	small	cluster	no	You can also call verbena "vervain," which has a great mouthfeel.
pink vein calibrachoa	Calibrachoa	pink	5	notched	small	trumpet	no	I had to include this guy even though I have another calibrachoa—the pink veins sare just too cool! And look how the center is full of lovely ruffles!
Japanese snowball	Viburnum	white	4	notched	medium	cluster	no	The flower clusters in this particular tree were pretty flat, but you can cultivate varieties of this shrub so the clusters are actually ball-shaped.
Virginia spiderwort	Tradescantia	purple	3	ruffled	small	star	no	I don't know about you, but this flower looks nothing like a spider to me.
Sicilian honey garlic	Allium	green;purple;brown	many	pointy	medium	bell	no	Also known as Mediterranean bells.
yellow pansy	Viola	yellow	5	round;ruffled	medium	flat	no	Pansy petals remind me of butterfly wings! 
coral honeysuckle	Lonicera	red;pink	5	round;fused	medium	trumpet	no	Honeysuckle flowers are so different-looking from each other, I'm starting to suspect that we just slap the name "honeysuckle" on any funky viny plant. According to Wikipedia, this plant is so flammable it's not recommended you plant it near residences.
rhododendron	Rhododendron	pink	5	ruffled;notched;round	medium	cluster	no	Did you know all azaleas are rhododendrons, but not all rhododendrons are azaleas? 
Miquel's mazus	Mazus	purple	4	fused;notched;round	small	funky	no	This species is native to Japan and China, and invasive everywhere else. It's so funky-looking I can almost forgive it.
alpine columbine	Aquilegia	purple	5	round	medium	star	no	Columbines are one of the first kinds of flowers I learned to recognize in the wild! It's nice to find a type of flower that is all the same shape (I'm looking at you, clematis).
pink honeysuckle	Lonicera	red	many	round	small	bowl	no	It's like a Christmas spider!
scrambled eggs	Corydalis	yellow;orange	4	fused	small	stalk	no	Other names for this flower include golden smoke and golden corydalis, which you could use if for some reason you don't adore the moniker "scrambled eggs."
Pink Panther coral bells	Heuchera	white;pink	many	fused	small	stalk	no	With leaves as cool as these, you barely need flowers. That's probably why these bells are so small!
heucherella	Heuchera x Tiarella	pink	many	pointy	small	stalk	no	These flowers are a cross between coral bells and foam flowers, so you can call them "foamy bells."
kousa dogwood	Cornus	white;green	4	pointy	medium	star	yes	You can also call kousa dogwood "strawberry tree," presumably because its fruits are red. (Red spikeballs, that is. It's hard to imagine someone mistaking them for strawberries.)
bluestars	Amsonia	blue	5	pointy	medium	stalk	no	A perfect name for this lovely plant! Finally, a flower named "blue" that isn't purple.
rose	Rosa	orange	many	ruffled;notched	large	rose-like	no	This is just an example of a rose. I grew up with only rose bushes separating my house with the neighbors'. It was a favorite summer pastime of mine to spot different colors, but I'm still mad that the purple roses were never on my side of the bush. 
Crystal Fountain clematis	Clematis	purple;white	many	pointy	large	star	no	Clematis is absurd! I don't have a picture of hairy clematis yet, but oh boy, you could certainly look it up.
purple bloody geranium	Geranium	purple	5	notched;rounded square	medium	bowl	no	I'm tacking the name "purple" onto this plant because I've already got a pink bloody geranium on here.
catmint	Nepeta	purple	3	fused;notched	medium	stalk	no	According to Wikipedia, two-thirds of cats have an intense attraction towards this plant (which I prefer to call catmint instead of catnip).
seep monkeyflower	Erythranthe	yellow	5	fused;notched;round	small	trumpet	no	You know, these kinda look like monkeys.
aspen bluebells	Mertensia	blue;purple	5	round;ruffled	small	bell	no	Stunning! These are a pleasure to stumble upon on a dewy morning mountain hike. They're an almost iridescent blue-purple, usually found by water.
creeping Oregon grape	Mahonia	yellow	many	round;notched	small	cluster	no	Apparently I found this plant too soon—later in the season it'll be full of blue berries. The internet tells me those berries are good jelly ingredients.
tall western groundsel	Senecio	yellow	many	pointy;notched	small	daisy-like	no	This flower's other common name, lambstongue ragwort, is pretty funky.
western wallflower	Erysimum	yellow	4	rounded square	medium	stalk	no	I get why this is called wallflower (also, prairie rocket). This particular specimen required a bit of rock climbing to get to.
ballhead waterleaf	Hydrophyllum	white;purple	5	pointy;rounded square	small	ball	no	Waterleaf is such a lovely purple-white color :)
serviceberry	Amelanchier	white	5	round;ruffled	small	cluster	no	You can eat serviceberry fruits! I haven't yet, but I might come back to the pictured shrub later.
chokecherry	Prunus	white	5	round;notched	medium	stalk	no	I love the smell of chokecherries! Unfortunately, Wikipedia says they are pesty—perhaps because they host all sorts of bugs?
fernleaf desert parsley	Lomatium	yellow	many	round	medium	cluster	no	It was hard to identify this one—I'm just pretty sure it's a parsley.
heartleaf arnica	Arnica	yellow	many	pointy	medium	daisy-like	no	What a pleasant surprise to find on a hike!
field bindweed	Convolvulus	white;pink	5	ruffled;rounded square	small	trumpet	no	These flowers are part of the morning glory family.
Lewis flax	Linum	blue	5	rounded square	small	flat	no	I love flax! These lovelies are one of my favorites to find in front gardens.
yellow salsify	Tragopogon	yellow	many	notched;round	medium	daisy-like	no	Salsify: a fancy name for a fancy flower. You can also call it goatsbeard, for reasons unknown, or oysterplant.
bristly locust	Robinia	pink	5	fused;round	large	funky	yes	Locusts are such lovely trees!
dipelta	Dipelta	white	5	round;ruffled	small	trumpet	no	This shrub doesn't have a common name yet—a shame! I think we should call it starfishplant.
president clematis	Clematis	purple	many	pointy;ruffled	large	star	no	What the heck! This type of clematis is called "the President."
red creeping thyme	Thymus	purple	4	round;notched	small	flat	no	I saw this filling in the gaps between some paving stones and I love that! Ban grass.
moonshine yarrow	Achillea	yellow	many	notched	medium	cluster	no	Moonshine yarrow is so bright I bet you could see it from space.
yellow avens	Geum	yellow	5	round;ruffled	small	star	no	This silly thing also comes in a brownish-purple spikeball version! You should see it sometime!
California poppy	Eschscholzia	orange	4	ruffled;rounded square	medium	cup	no	This bright and lovely flower is a pleasure to spot! It's sometimes called cup of gold, which is silly because "cup of orange" would be more accurate and more of a tasty idea.
red valerian	Centranthus	pink	5	round	small	cluster	no	A pleasant addition to any garden, red valerian has plenty of exciting monikers including devil's beard and kiss-me-quick.
lesser periwinkle	Vinca	purple	5	rounded square	small	star	no	This flower is one of my favorites! It's such a fun pinwheel shape. According to Wikipedia, it's sometimes called "myrtle" in the United States.
snow-in-summer	Cerastium	white	5	notched;round	small	star	no	Snow-in-summer is a perfect name for a flower. I love this one because of how sneaky it is—you almost don't notice there are flowers against the pale leaves until you look again!
coral bells	Heuchera	red	5	round;fused	small	stalk	no	Just some regular coral bells, a flower from before the word "red" was invented.
sweet William	Dianthus	white	5	notched	small	flat	no	No one's sure why this flower's called sweet William. It doesn't really look like it wants me to eat it.
creeping jenny	Lysimachia	yellow	5	notched;pointy	small	bowl	no	You can call this plant moneywort, or twopenny grass. Its monetary names come from the "coin-like" (I don't really see it) shape of its leaves.
spiked speedwell	Veronica	purple	4	fused;round;ruffled	small	stalk	no	The name speedwell reminds me of Birdwell, the name of Kronk's love interest in the movie Kronk's New Groove, which I think is a good thing.
fuzzy deutzia	Deutzia	white	many	pointy	medium	stalk	no	This variety of deutzia has double flowers, which either means flowers with extra petals or flowers within flowers! So cool!
Scottish bluebell	Campanula	purple	5	pointy;fused	small	bell	no	Scotland, we might assume, did not invent the word purple for quite some time. (This plant is also known as harebell.)
red dahlia	Dahlia	red	many	pointy;notched	medium	circle	no	According to Wikipedia, dahlias have very nutritious tubers.
fringed pink	Dianthus	white	5	pointy;notched	small	star	no	This stuff is so weird! "Fringed pink" also sounds like only half of a name. So does "large pink," the other common name for this flower. Like, what is it that is large and pink? Huh?
Starburst chrysanthemum	Chrysanthemum	white	many	pointy;notched	medium	daisy-like	no	If you zoom way in, you can see a teeny bug on one of these flowers! It might be a cricket or a grasshopper. One of them jumpy things.
Nuttall's larkspur	Delphinium	blue;purple	5	pointy;ruffled	medium	stalk	no	What a dazzling sight! These beauties are also called two-lobe larkspur, upland larkspur, and common larkspur.
petunia	Petunia	yellow;white;purple	5	ruffled;fused;rounded square	medium	trumpet	no	These are so fun! Also fun fact, the name petunia comes from a South American word for tobacco.
lobelia	Lobelia	purple	5	pointy;rounded square	small	funky	no	It just now occured to me that lobelias are probably called lobelias because they are so lobe-y.
feverfew	Tanacetum	white	many	rounded square;notched	small	daisy-like	no	Whew! This is the kind of stuff you might get at an apothecary: it's called feverfew because it was once thought to reduce fevers.
trailing iceplant	Lampranthus	purple	many	pointy;round	medium	daisy-like	no	I love iceplant! Its leaves are so succulent. 
poppy	Papaver	pink	3	ruffled	large	bowl	no	I don't know exactly what kind of poppy this is but I had to include it because I got such a happy shot of that wheel-looking thing in its center!
Ascot Rainbow spurge	Euphorbia x martinii	yellow;brown	2	round;fused	small	cluster	no	If you like this plant, you could splurge on spurge.
sacred datura	Datura	white	5	fused;pointy	large	trumpet	no	This plant can also be called thornapple, after its prickly seed pods. Also, it is very poisonous, which sorta makes sense given that it looks like a monster bindweed.
ragwort	Senecio	yellow	many	round;notched	small	daisy-like	no	The internet is not good at identifying the thousands of flowers that look like this, so ragwort is my best guess.
houndstooth	Cynoglossum	red;purple	5	rounded square	small	cluster	no	This flower has the absolute weirdest common name I've ever heard of. Houndstongue, dog's tongue, and gypsy flower are all par for alternate common names... but you can also call this "rats and mice."
camas	Camassia	purple;blue	6	pointy	medium	stalk	no	My oh my! Camas (also quamash, camash, and wild hyacinth) comes in meadows and its subtle blue-purple is a delight to see. (And don't worry—it's not related to the full-of-poison meadow death camas.)
Adam's needle	Yucca	white	5	pointy	large	stalk	no	These hanging flowers are so noticeable! I love how big they are.
Japanese meadowsweet	Spiraea	pink	5	pointy;round	small	cluster	no	If you look closely, these flowers appear to have clipped wires coming out of them.
large-leaved lupine	Lupinus	purple	4	fused	medium	stalk	no	Lupine is so fine!
two-row stonecrop	Phedimus	white;pink	5	pointy	small	cluster	no	This plant can be referred to as "Caucasian stonecrop," which led me to look up where the word "Caucasian" comes from—it's the Caucasus, between the Caspian and Black Seas.
Plenifora Japanese kerria	Kerria	yellow	many	ruffled	small	carnation-like	no	My best guess is that this plant is the double-flowered cultivar of Japanese kerria, although the flowers I saw were smaller than Plenifora is supposed to be.
upright prairie coneflower	Ratibida	yellow	many	round;notched	medium	cone	no	"Mexican hat" and "longhead prairie coneflower" are alternative names for this funky-looking cone with a skirt.
goldenrod	Solidago	yellow	many	round	medium	stalk	no	This flower makes me think of the song "Casimiar Pulaski Day" by Suvjan Stevens.
elderberry	Sambucus	white	5	round	large	cluster	no	It's elderberry! It's enormous!
Black Lace elderberry	Sambucus	white	5	round	large	cluster	no	I think this variety of elderberry is copyright protected.
daphne	Daphne	white	4	pointy	small	cluster	no	Daphne is a pretty name and a paper shrub, which means it's used to make paper (in this case, mostly in Nepal).
Colorado four o'clock	Mirabilis	purple	5	round;fused	medium	trumpet	no	The color of this flower is in a very tricky place between pink and purple. (Unrelatedly, the powdered root of this plant is allegedly good at reducing appetite.)
Paprika yarrow	Achillea	red	5	notched;rounded square	medium	cluster	no	What delightful stuff!
Italian bellflower	Campanula	white	5	pointy	small	bell	no	This little crawling plant is also known as falling stars, trailing campanula, and star of Bethlehem.
Hens & Chicks	Sempervivum	pink	many	pointy	small	star	no	Cobweb house-leek is perhaps the more interesting of this plant's common names. It's no doubt called that because its little furry leaf cluster things look like they're covered in cobwebs.
rose campion	Silene	pink	5	notched;rounded square	medium	flat	no	This plant's got some funky alternative names like dusty miller, mullein-pink, and bloody William (which perhaps is the opposite of sweet William).
fireweed	Chamaenerion	purple	5	rounded;notched	large	stalk	no	Fireweed looks nothing like fire! That name comes from how well this plant swoops in on sites that have just had forest fires and such. (For example, it's called bombweed in the UK because it came in after blitzes.) If you don't like thinking about fires or bombs you can call this willowherb.
butterfly weed	Asclepias	orange	5	pointy	medium	cluster	no	This is a type of milkweed! It's got a whole list of entertaining common names like orange Swallow-wort, windroot, and butterfly love.
lavender	Lavandula	purple	5	round;notched	small	stalk	no	What a lovely pollinator plant! You can distinguish this from Russian sage by its size (lavender is smaller) and leaves (long thin leaves instead of compound ones).
alfalfa	Medicago	purple	5	round;fused	small	ball	no	Fun fact about alfalfa: its name comes from an Old Persian phrase meaning "horse food."
Stansbury's cliffrose	Purshia	white;yellow	5	notched	small	flat	no	As you can see, a sci-fi monster overtakes these flowers in the summertime.
Rocky Mountain beeplant	Cleome	pink	4	round	small	cluster	no	This plant is also known as Navajo spinach, guaco, skunk weed, stinking-clover, and bee spider-flower. I chose to go with "Rocky Mountain beeplant" since it seemed the least offensive (and also because I've got tons of spider-flowers on this site already—maybe we can use octopus flower next?).
creeping thistle	Cirsium	purple	many	pointy	medium	ball	no	Also known as Canada thistle, field thistle, and... lettuce from hell thistle.
paintbrush	Castilleja	red	many	pointy	medium	stalk	no	It's paintbrush! A perfectly named flower!
bittersweet nightshade	Solanum	purple	5	pointy	small	cluster	no	The berry of this plant is attractive but poisonous, which is perhaps why it's also referred to by names such as poisonflower, snakeberry, felonwort, and poisonberry. 
katniss	Sagittaria	white	3	rounded square;notched	medium	flat	no	I am a big fan of the Hunger Games so I'm disappointed that I didn't realize what this was at the time. It's also called wapato, Indian potato, and broadleaf arrowhead—you can find it in many wet-ish-lands, and eat it, which Suzanne Collin totally gets right in her books.
pepperweed	Lepidium	white	4	round	small	cluster	no	Pepperweed is my best guess for this one. It's a good guess though, right? 
hardy blue-flowered leadwort	Ceratostigma	blue	5	rounded square;notched	small	flat	no	Leadwort is brilliant and I think more flowers should be bright blue!
St. John's wort	Hypericum	yellow	5	pointy	medium	star	no	This is such a fun, ridiculous flower with lots of potential medicinal purposes. It's named after St. John because it tends to blossom around St. John's Feast Day, June 24.
Strawberry Candy daylily	Hemerocallis	pink	6	fused;ruffled	large	trumpet	no	What a frilly friend! This daylily, according to the internet, has a red eyezone. I didn't even know flowers had eyes.
California fuschia	Epilobium	red	4	notched;round	small	trumpet	no	I'm tempted to call this Zauschneria, which was its genus name before people figured it would fit better in Epilobium. It's also known by the fun titles firechalice and hummingbird trumpet.
sunflower	Helianthus	yellow	many	pointy;notched	large	daisy-like	no	Who doesn't like a good sunflower? 
rubber rabbitbrush	Ericameria	yellow	many	pointy	small	cluster	no	I'm pretty sure this is rubber rabbitbrush, also known as chamisa. It's called rabbitbrush because jackrabbits like to hide in it.
shortstem buckwheat	Eriogonum	yellow	many	round;fused	small	cluster	no	Gotta be honest—it was kind of disappointing to go on a summer hike and only find yellow wildflowers.
white heath aster	Symphyotrichum	white	many	pointy	small	daisy-like	no	This stuff's also called "frost aster," which is a fun phrase to say fast.
Nanho Purple butterfly bush	Buddleia	pink;purple	5	notched;ruffled	small	stalk	no	This looks absolutely nothing like butterfly weed but is somehow just as stunning.
Russian sage	Salvia	purple	5	round;notched;fused	small	stalk	no	A friendly (but messy-looking) pollinator plant that looks much like lavender. It's got compound leaves and is slightly lighter in color.
beeblossom	Oenothera	white	4	pointy	small	star	no	Also known as clockweed and white gaura, this plant has flowers that look more like butterflies than bees!
purple coneflower	Echinacea	pink	many	notched	medium	daisy-like	no	The centers of coneflowers are mesmerizing :O
black-eyed Susan	Rudbeckia	yellow	many	notched	medium	daisy-like	no	Poor Susan, I wonder what happened to her. (You can also call this flower poor-land daisy and yellow ox-eye daisy.)
red hot poker	Kniphofia	orange;yellow	1	fused	large	stalk	no	This friend, native to Africa, can also be referred to as tritoma, torch lily, and poker plant.
