Common names	Genus	Colors	Petals	Petal edge	Size	Flower shape	Tree?	Description
evergreen candytuft	Iberis	white	many	rounded square	small	cluster	no	Candytuft! What a delightful name for a delightful flower. There is something immensely satisfying (but also frightening) about a cluster of flowers so thick you can't see any green. 
scarlet globemallow	Sphaeralcea	orange	5	notched	small	bowl	no	Not totally scarlet, globular, or mallow-y, this nonetheless pleasant wildflower is also known as "cowboy's delight." In late spring you can see large patches of these on drier hills in Utah, whether or not you're on horseback.
spreading phlox	Phlox	pink	5	round;rounded square	small	flat	no	These flowers really do spread—you can catch them in enormous patches in shady areas pretty easily, because they can't run.
Sarah Bernhardt peony	Paeonia	pink	many	notched;ruffled	large	carnation-like	no	This enormous, gorgeous flower is like a giant cross between a carnation and a rose.
showy milkweed	Asclepias	pink	5	pointy	large	ball	no	As far as I can tell, the show this flower's putting on is called "Ball of starfish."
tapertip onion	Allium	purple	many	pointy	small	ball	no	Also called Hooker's onion, this plant is allegedly quite delicious. 
Colorado blue columbine	Aquilegia	white	5	round	medium	star	no	I'm not completely sure that I've identified these flowers correctly, but I do know they're columbines—you can tell because they have funky little tails coming out the back (called "spurs").
smoothstem blazingstar	Mentzelia	yellow	5	pointy	large	star	no	This is one of my favorite wildflowers. I love its extravagant name! In early summer, you can find small shrubs in bloom with these highlighter-yellow flowers—act quick, though, because those shrubs will quickly dry out into sad skeletons.
chicory	Cichorium	purple	many	notched	small	daisy-like	no	This elusive purple-blue wildflower is a joy to spot! It's rather hard to pick off individual flowers, so I might recommend stealing the entire bush.
natal plum	Carissa	white	5	round	medium	star	no	These elegant stars are a perfect fit for beachside stroll aesthetics.
purple morning glory	Ipomoea	purple	5	notched	medium	trumpet	no	These are much more eye-catching than the pale pink morning glory that is slowly eating away my hometown.
Texas lantana	Lantana	yellow;orange	4	notched;round	small	cluster	no	Lantana is a common choice for city-street flowerpots. I love its colorful clusters, but I'm still not sure how many petals it has.
lion's tail	Leonotis	orange	many	fuzzy	small	cluster	no	This flower is also called "wild dagga," which sounds like a useful survival tool.
globe amaranth	Gomphrena	pink;purple	many	pointy;notched	small	ball	no	Wow! These vibrant blooms are extra cool when you look at them close up. At some point I'll add support for multiple photos on this site so you can have that experience.
balloon flower	Platycodon	purple	5	pointy	large	star	no	Strangely, these might be the least balloon-looking flowers I've ever seen.
toad lily	Tricyrtis	white;purple	6	round	small	star	no	I love these funky gems! They are NOTHING like toads!
dahlia	Dahlia	pink	many	round;notched	large	ball	no	A classy, easily recognizable flower with a name you could comfortably use on your kid.
fire vine	Ipomoea	red;orange;yellow	5	none	small	stalk	no	Also known as Spanish flag and firecracker vine, this silly flower brings to mind a pile of happy toucans!
bluemink	Ageratum	purple	many	pointy	small	cluster	no	I'm a huge fan of this flower's name, which seems like it came from a lazy guy trying to get out of his hunting duties back in the days when the color purple hadn't been invented yet. "I'm gonna go look for blue mink!" or something. You can also call it "flossflower."
crested cockscomb	Celosia	red;pink	many	ruffled	large	ruffle	no	I'm a little upset by this one because it's hard to categorize and looks way too much like a brain.
white campion	Silene	white	5	notched	small	gourd	no	When I look at these I imagine the taste of wintermelon, a vegetable I hate.
lanceleaf liveforever	Dudleya	red;orange;yellow	6	pointy	small	stalk	no	I think everything to know about this flower is included in its absurdly original name, the most flagrant offender I've seen of flower-namer-people Just Making Up Words since "smoothstem blazingstar."
seafoam statice	Limonium	purple;white	5	round;notched	small	cluster	no	A lovely cluster also known as Perez's sea lavender—take a moment to spot the intermittent little white flowers!
verbena	Verbena	purple	5	notched	small	cluster	no	It's a ball of flowers, hiding a fuzzy little secret...
painter's palette	Anthurium	red;yellow	2	fused	large	leaf	no	A leaf disguised as a flower, this thing is also called flamingo flower, oilcloth flower, and laceleaf.
Texas bluebonnet	Lupinus	purple;yellow;white	many	round	large	stalk	no	This photo was taken just off of a highway in Texas in the springtime, just like Lady Bird Johnson wanted. 
evening primrose	Oenothera	white;pink	4	notched	large	bag	no	I classify the shape of this flower as "bag" because no flower has looked more like a discarded plastic bag to me. These flowers have no integrity—this photo was taken at 8AM, a far cry from "evening."
sego lily	Calochortus	white	3	pointy	small	cup	no	Utah's state flower is much smaller than you might expect. Look closely off-trail in late spring to spot it, and be careful up close—sego lilies make good homes for spiders and other yucky bugs.
spider milkweed	Asclepias	green;purple	5	pointy	large	ball	no	Also called antelope horns milkweed, this flower is absolutely bonkers.
narrow-leaf penstemon	Penstemon	purple	5	round;notched	small	stalk	no	You can also call this plant toax-flax beardtongue—I'm not sure why.
thistle	Cirsium	purple	many	pointy	medium	gourd	no	This thistle is hosting a soldier beetle friend!
Lotus japonicus	Lotus	yellow	2	round;pointy	small	cluster	no	To my dismay, this cutie has no common name yet. Sunshine horseshoeflower, anyone?
musk-mallow	Malva	pink	5	notched	small	bowl	no	After looking at all these flowers called "mallow," I'm really curious who was responsible for naming marshmallows.
wild carrot;Queen Anne's lace;bird's nest	Daucus	white	many	round	large	cluster	no	Alternative names for this plant include wild carrot and bird's nest, neither of which evoke as fun of an image as Queen Anne's lace. If you look closely you can see a red dot in the center of the flower cluster that represents blood from Queen Anne pricking her finger while making the lace, which is pretty disgusting if you ask me.
bird vetch	Vicia	purple	2	round;fused	small	stalk	no	This flower has a lot of other arguably descriptive common names such as tufted vetch, boreal vetch, cow vetch, and blue vetch. The only thing the flower community seems to have agreed upon is that it's vetch!
red clover	Trifolium	pink	many	round;pointy	small	ball	no	:)
crownvetch	Securigera	pink	many	round	small	cluster	no	I would like to talk to the person who came up with the name vetch, because it sounds much too pointy for flowers!
buttonbush	Cephalanthus	white;brown	many	pointy	small	ball	no	Also called honey-bells, this flower was too spiky for this bee to linger long.
garden nasturtium	Tropaeolum	orange	5	ruffled;round;notched	medium	cup	no	Nasturtium is an appropriate name for a flower that is beautiful but looks like it would gossip if it could.
everlasting flower	Helichrysum	pink;white	many	round	small	daisy-like	no	I love the shiny mysteriousness of this flower! We may never know what it's hiding in its heart.
trumpet vine	Campsis	orange	5	round;notched	small	trumpet	no	The alternative name for this flower, "cow itch vine," raises a lot of questions.
desert wirelettuce	Stephanomeria	pink	5	notched	small	star	no	I had a hard time identifying this flower and may have done it wrong—I've thought before that it's skeletonplant. It's got impressive spork petals.
narrowleaf four o'clock	Mirabilis	white;pink	5	notched	small	trumpet	no	Four o'clocks were thusly named because they open at four o'clock, and I guess the people who named them had never been up at 7AM like I have.
Egyptian starcluster	Pentas	pink	5	pointy	small	cluster	no	The color of these flowers does not evoke Egypt for me. Instead, I'm thinking about a shirt I thought was cool in 2014...
African daisy	Dimorphotheca	white;pink	many	spoon	medium	daisy-like	no	These are some of the mesmerizingest flowers I've spotted. Also called Cape marguerite, their petals look like, but cannot be used as, spoons.
nemesia	Nemesia	red;pink;yellow	many	round;notched	medium	cluster	no	Tutu designers could learn a thing or two from these flowers!
spider flower	Grevilla	red;green	many	round;pointy	small	ball	no	I'd have named this anything other than spider flower.
blue felicia	Felicia	purple	many	round	small	daisy-like	no	This flower is another relic from the days before purple was invented.
tiger-eye pansy	Viola	yellow;brown	5	round;notched	small	flat	no	According to Wikipedia, pansies are hybrid creations, like donkeys.
anemone	Anemone	white;pink;red;purple	many	round;rounded square	large	bowl	no	Sea anemones were named after anemone flowers because both are colorful, which is hilarious because I can think of plenty of flowers that are just as colorful AND easier to spell.
common stork's-bill	Erodium	pink	5	round;rounded square	small	star	no	Also called redstem filaree and pinweed, this flower is known as stork's bill because it's got sharp, beak-looking seed-pods.
birdeye speedwell	Veronica	blue	4	round	small	bowl	no	Other names for this plant include winter speedwell and bird's-eye. 
dandelion	Taraxacum	yellow	many	notched	medium	circle	no	This one has a red soldier bug on it!
grape hyacinth	Muscari	purple	1	round;notched	small	stalk	no	Neither hyacinth nor grapes.
apple	Malus	white	5	round;ruffled	small	bowl	yes	I adore the smell of this flower! Much better than the fishy smell of the Bradford pear.
grass lily	Ornithogalum	white	6	pointy	small	cup	no	Also called nap-at-noon and eleven-o'clock lady, these little lilies were a stellar surprise to find on the side of a trail. 
Japanese wisteria	Wisteria	white;purple	2	fused;pointy;round	large	stalk	no	I'm not actually sure if this one is a tree.
Kanzan cherry	Prunus	pink	many	notched;ruffled	medium	carnation-like	yes	In my humble opinion, the best color of tree is pink!
Chinese redbud	Cercis	pink	5	round;fused	small	cluster	yes	With fiercely magenta flowers, these trees make a powerful contribution to any springtime neighborhood.
lilac	Syringa	white;pink	4	round	small	stalk	no	An unassuming shrub in most seasons, the lilac is a wonderful surprise in the spring.
Pursh's milkvetch	Astragalus	pink;purple	4	round;ruffled;fused	medium	cluster	no	So strangely shaped my janky classification system struggles to describe it, Pursh's milkvetch exists to push the boundaries of what a flower is. Why do the flowers come in threes (or maybe fours—is that a bud in the photo)? Why are they so long? What's going on with the petals?
meadow death camas	Toxicoscordion	white;yellow	5	ruffled;round	small	staslk	no	If you eat 2-6% of your body weight in meadow death camas, you'll probably die.
milkvetch	Astragalus	white;yellow	4	round;notched;fused	small	cluster	no	I'm not sure what variety of milkvetch this is—the other yellow-white milkvetches I found, on top of not having the same leaves as this one, tended to be native to an extremely specific region beyond where I found this. (Which is why we should have more dichotomous keys!)
